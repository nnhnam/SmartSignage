# Smart Mirror

They say it is impossible to pass a mirror and not take a glance at yourself.
We've decided to test it out in our modern solution - Smart Mirror.

## Problems of interest
[Junction 2019](https://2019.hackjunction.com/challenges/smart-signage-for-students-by-students)

AYY has been planning to install information screens (smart signage) to the stairwells and hallways of its apartment buildings.
They wanted us to come up with interesting ideas on what it can show, what look like and how it will attract the attention of the building's residents.

## Functionalities

Smart Mirror looks like an ordinary mirror when no one is around. But as soon as someone walks by and activates the motion detector, it lights up! 
It immediately shows you the time, leaving buses, and cheers you up with a nice compliment.

As AYY has a lot of people moving in and out, the majority of them values information about the building facilities.
Our House Info page shows:
- the map, so new tenants will easily find laundry and gym, 
- lists up all the upcoming events, 
- to those already local ones - reminders about free saunas and laundry turns, so they don't forget to book it in time.

Postmen can enjoy a long list of tenants and can have them both in alphabetical and apartment number order.

For AYY we've designed our favorite page.
Buildings need a lot of maintenance, and AYY is always busy with it. Getting fault reports, choosing a company to take care of it, arrange a visit day, pay them, get feedback, realize it's been months and people are angry...

The process is long and complicated.
Tenants get frustrated and don't have any means to bring AYY's attention to the most irritating issues.
We wanted AYY to know their priorities and immediately know how well the problem was taken care of.

Problems page gives tenants a possibility to vote up all the important issues in the building, and feedback works the same way as the "smiley face system" in cafeterias and shops. Not accurate, but quick and effective.

Our Github has an example of how, if AYY were to implement a fault report in Domo system, it could be easily collected and processed to a small database, and then go directly to the screens. 

## Advantages

We've created an idea that can be used by AYY in any form they like. 
The reflexive surface is very affordable and gives a futuristic feeling.
The dark theme helps reducing the power consumption of the signage.
The design itself works whether they get slightly expensive touchscreens or not: that's why our mockup is operated only by the buttons on the bottom. 
If needed, they can be easily transferred to a small tablet or phone - and the company doesn't have to spend loads of money.

## Hardware
The following hardware is required for the implementation of the signage :
- TV screen
- Motion sensor
- Tablet/Buttons
- Reflective film
- Raspberry Pi / Arduino
